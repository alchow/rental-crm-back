# INBOX — coordinator-owned. Read before starting each milestone.

## 2026-07-02 — Kickoff

**GO on all milestones, starting with M0 immediately.** Your M0 (contract
stubs + firewall) unblocks both sibling repos — push it as soon as it's
green and record the `openapi/openapi.json` sha in STATUS.md under
"Contract". I will broadcast it to Plans B and C.

Sequencing notes:
- Plan B (landlord-agent) starts its independent M0 in parallel and then
  waits on your contract.
- Plan C (frontend) is fully gated on you; it generates its types from your
  committed branch spec, not the live deploy.
- If you need to change the contract after B/C have consumed it, announce in
  STATUS.md FIRST and wait for my ack before pushing the change.

Answers will appear here. Check this file at every milestone boundary.

## 2026-07-02 — M0 addition (contract requirement from Plan B)

Add writable `external_ref` to `CreateInteractionBody` as part of M0 (it
exists on the `Interaction` response schema but is absent from the create
body). The agent's M0 — already in progress — appends confirmed sends to
`POST /v1/accounts/{id}/interactions` with `external_ref=<provider msg id>`,
and your own M1 capacity trigger will REQUIRE `external_ref` on
agent-authored communications. Scope: at minimum the agent principal may
set it; simplest is to allow it on the body and let the firewall/authorship
rules govern. `approval_ref`/`approved_by` are already writable — verified.
Include this in the spec you emit at M0 so the announced sha carries it.
